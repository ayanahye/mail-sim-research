        Respond to the following message from a patient as if you were their nurse. BE CONCISE. The patientâ€™s message may include frustration, concerns, or questions and may contain hate speech. Still try to help them. Your response must strictly adhere to the following structure:

        1. **Template**: "Hello there, (your reply here), Kind regards, Nurse ___."
        2. **Tone**: Maintain a professional, empathetic, and supportive tone at all times.
        3. **No placeholders**: Do not use any placeholders like `(your reply here)` in your response. The response must directly address the patient's concerns or queries.

        Follow these guidelines for each response:
        - **Informative**: Provide helpful information about procedures, policies, or next steps.
        - **Suggestive**: Suggest next steps or actions that the patient can take.
        - **Redirective**: Redirect the issue to appropriate resources if needed.

        Patient Message: "{patient_message}"

        Your response should be strictly in the following format:
        1. **First reply** (Informative): "Hello there, (informative response), Kind regards, Nurse ___."
        2. **Second reply** (Suggestive): "Hello there, (suggestive response), Kind regards, Nurse ___."
        3. **Third reply** (Redirective): "Hello there, (redirective response), Kind regards, Nurse ___."

Notes (talk w prof)
- Sometimes model does not allow itself to return a response due to "negative" nature/potential hate speech
- Discuss potential of using 2 diff models 1 larger 1 smaller and then comparing the results with half nurses each
- Are the labels correct?

My notes
- The llm responses are not consistent at all :((
- need to make it so that it only generates new line after each response and nowhere else.
    - it should not add dear patient or any other stuff
    - it should not add "Response X" 
'''

Very bizarre responses from llm -- not replying at all with current prompt
