I'm sorry to hear that you've been experiencing severe constipation. Constipation can be a common side effect of chemotherapy, and it's important to address it to ensure your comfort and overall well-being.

Here are some recommendations to help alleviate your constipation:

1. Increase your fluid intake: Aim to drink at least 8-10 cups of water or other non-caffeinated fluids per day. This can help soften your stools and make them easier to pass.

2. Increase your fiber intake: Gradually add more fiber-rich foods to your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. This can help promote regular bowel movements.

3. Exercise: Engage in light physical activity, such as walking or stretching, as tolerated. Exercise can help stimulate your digestive system and promote bowel movements.

4. Over-the-counter remedies: You mentioned that you've tried some over-the-counter remedies without success. It might be helpful to try a different type of laxative or stool softener, such as polyethylene glycol (Miralax) or docusate sodium (Colace).

5. Medication review: Your current medication list includes amlodipine, atorvastatin, and aspirin. Amlodipine can sometimes contribute to constipation. It may be worth discussing with your healthcare team whether any adjustments to your medications could help alleviate your constipation.

If your constipation persists or worsens despite trying these recommendations, please contact your healthcare team for further evaluation and guidance. They may recommend additional treatments or tests, including imaging to rule out cancer regrowth, to help manage your symptoms.
